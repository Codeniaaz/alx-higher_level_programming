nheritance in programming is a powerful concept where a new class, known as a subclass or derived class, can inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class, called a superclass or base class. This promotes code reuse, allowing the subclass to utilize the functionalities of the superclass while also extending or customizing its own. Inheritance fosters a hierarchical structure in code, enhancing modularity, and simplifying the development process by creating a relationship between classes based on similarity and specialization.
