ORM, or Object-Relational Mapping, is a programming technique used to bridge the gap between the object-oriented world of application code and the relational world of databases. Instead of writing SQL queries directly, developers can work with objects in their programming language of choice, and the ORM library takes care of translating these objects into relational database tables and vice versa.

ORMs simplify database interactions by abstracting away the complexities of SQL and providing a more intuitive interface for developers. They typically offer features like automatic schema generation, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, query building, and relationships mapping between objects.

Popular ORM frameworks include SQLAlchemy for Python, Hibernate for Java, Entity Framework for .NET, and ActiveRecord for Ruby on Rails. While ORM can make development faster and more straightforward, it's essential to understand its underlying mechanisms and performance implications to use it effectively in projects.
