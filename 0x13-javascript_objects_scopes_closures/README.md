Certainly!

In JavaScript, constants declared with `const` cannot be reassigned after they are initialized. This means that once a value is assigned to a constant, it cannot be changed throughout the program's execution. This behavior helps ensure that certain values remain constant and do not accidentally change, improving code reliability and maintainability.
