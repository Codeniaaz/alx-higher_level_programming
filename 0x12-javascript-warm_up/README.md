JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for web development. Initially created to add interactivity to web pages, it has evolved into a powerful tool for building complex web applications. Its versatility extends to server-side development, mobile app development, and even desktop application development. JavaScript's popularity is largely due to its ease of use, extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks (such as React, Angular, and Vue.js), and its ability to run on virtually any platform with a web browser.
