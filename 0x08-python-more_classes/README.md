Classes and Objects in Python:

Classes:

Definition: A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a data structure along with methods to operate on that data.
Purpose: Classes provide a way to structure and organize code. They encapsulate data and behavior, promoting modularity and code reusability.
Components:
Attributes: Variables that store data.
Methods: Functions that operate on the data.
Example:
python
Copy code
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand
        self.model = model

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} {self.model}")
Objects:

Definition: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and is created from the class blueprint.
Creation: Objects are created using the class constructor. Each object has its own set of attributes and can call the class methods.
Example:
python
Copy code
# Creating objects from the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic")

# Accessing attributes and calling methods
print(car1.brand)  # Output: Toyota
car2.display_info()  # Output: Honda Civic
Key Concepts:

Inheritance: Classes can inherit attributes and methods from other classes, promoting code reuse.
Encapsulation: The bundling of data and methods within a class, with control over access through access modifiers.
Polymorphism: Objects can take on multiple forms, allowing methods to be used interchangeably.
Benefits:

Abstraction: Classes allow abstraction, focusing on essential features and hiding implementation details.
Organization: Classes help organize code into manageable and logical units.
Reusability: Code written in classes can be reused in different parts of a program or in different programs.
In summary, classes and objects in Python provide a powerful way to model and structure code, promoting the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. They contribute to code organization, maintainability, and reusability.
