1. **Data Definition Language (DDL):** SQL includes commands for defining and altering the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints. Common DDL commands include CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML):** SQL provides commands for manipulating data within the database. This includes commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

3. **Data Control Language (DCL):** SQL includes commands for controlling access to data within the database. Examples include GRANT and REVOKE, which are used to grant or revoke privileges on database objects.

4. **Transaction Control Language (TCL):** SQL provides commands for managing transactions within the database. Commands like COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT are used to control the transactional behavior of SQL statements.

5. **Normalization:** SQL databases often follow normalization principles to organize data efficiently and reduce redundancy. Normalization helps minimize data duplication and ensures data integrity.

6. **Indexes:** Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval operations on database tables. They are created on columns to quickly locate rows that match a certain condition.

7. **Views:** Views are virtual tables derived from one or more underlying tables. They allow users to query data as if it were a regular table, while providing an abstraction layer over the underlying schema.

8. **Stored Procedures and Functions:** SQL allows the creation of stored procedures and functions, which are sets of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. They help improve code reusability, modularity, and security.

9. **Constraints:** Constraints are rules that enforce data integrity within the database. Common constraints include NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK constraints.

10. **Subqueries:** SQL supports subqueries, which are queries nested within another query. Subqueries can be used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements to retrieve or manipulate data based on the result of another query.

These are just some key concepts in SQL. It's a powerful language used for managing and manipulating relational databases, and there's always more to learn depending on your specific needs and the features supported by the database management system you're using.
