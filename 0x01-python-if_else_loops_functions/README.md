In Python, conditions are used to control the flow of a program, allowing it to make decisions based on whether certain conditions are true or false. Here are key points about conditions in Python:

if Statement:

The if statement is used to check a condition. If the condition is true, the indented block of code beneath it is executed.
python
Copy code
if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true
else Statement:

The else statement is used in conjunction with if to execute a block of code when the condition in the if statement is false.
python
Copy code
if condition:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is true
else:
    # Code to be executed if the condition is false
elif Statement:

The elif (else if) statement is used to check multiple conditions in sequence. It comes after an initial if statement and before an optional else statement.
python
Copy code
if condition1:
    #
