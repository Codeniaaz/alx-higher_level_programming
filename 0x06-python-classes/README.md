Classes:

Definition: In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It serves as a prototype that defines a set of attributes and behaviors common to all instances of that class.

Attributes/Properties: Classes encapsulate data through attributes, also known as properties or fields. These represent the characteristics or features of the objects belonging to the class.

Methods/Functions: Classes contain methods, which are functions associated with the class. These methods define the actions or behaviors that the objects of the class can perform.

Encapsulation: The concept of encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). This helps in organizing and structuring code.

Example:

python
Copy code
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def start_engine(self):
        print(f"The {self.make} {self.model}'s engine is running.")
Objects:

Instance of a Class: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete, tangible entity created from the class blueprint. Objects have a state (attributes) and behavior (methods) defined by the class.

Instantiation: The process of creating an object from a class is called instantiation. It involves calling the class constructor, which initializes the object's attributes.

Example:

python
Copy code
# Creating instances of the Car class
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Camry")
car2 = Car("Ford", "Mustang")

# Accessing attributes and calling methods
print(f"{car1.make} {car1.model}")
car2.start_engine()
Inheritance: Objects can inherit attributes and behaviors from a parent class through inheritance. This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy among classes.

Polymorphism: This concept allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It facilitates flexibility and adaptability in code design.

In summary, classes and objects are fundamental concepts in OOP that enable the creation of modular, reusable, and organized code by defining blueprints for objects with shared attributes and behaviors.
